## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

1. Whatsapp
   - Easy and convenient for communication - especially the announcements and group features.
   - Sending stickers, videos, and images. 

2. Instagram
   - Reels similar to tiktok, so I don't need to install additional apps
   - Posting stories and pictures 
  
3. Spotify
   - Downloading songs and playlists
   - Spotify wrapped feature
  
App I want to develop: 
A platform designed to help Computer Science students easily discover and access opportunities such as internships, hackathons, research projects, scholarships, and mentorship programs. The app streamlines scattered resources into one centralized hub, providing personalized recommendations, deadlines, and application tracking to empower students to grow academically and professionally.

## Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
It was challenging getting used to the user interface of XCode and interacting with many of its features.
